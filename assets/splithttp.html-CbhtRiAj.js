The transport will send the <code>X-Accel-Buffering: no</code> response header, but only some CDNs respect this. If the connection hangs, most likely this part does not work.</p><p>This transport serves the same purpose as Meek (support non-WS CDN). It has the above streaming requirement to the CDN so that download can be much faster than (v2fly) Meek, close to WebSocket performance. The upload is also optimized, but still much more limited than WebSocket.</p><p>Like WebSocket transport, SplitHTTP parses the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header for logging.</p><h2 id="splithttpobject" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#splithttpobject"><span>SplitHttpObject</span></a></h2><p>The <code>SplitHttpObject</code> corresponds to the <code>splithttpSettings</code> section under transport configurations.</p><div class="language-json line-numbers-mode" data-ext="json" data-title="json"><pre class="language-json"><code><span class="token punctuation">{</span>
