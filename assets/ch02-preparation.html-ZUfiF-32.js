This article takes a neutral stance on the project and does not make specific recommendations.

Please replace it with your real IP address).</li><li>Write down the SSH remote login port of VPS in a notebook.</li><li>Write down the username and password for SSH remote login in a notebook.</li></ol><p>Buying a VPS is a relatively complex matter. It is recommended to first learn the relevant knowledge and choose one that suits your own economic ability and line requirements. In addition, you can choose to take advantage of some benefits offered by international giants (such as permanent free or limited-time free packages offered by Oracle and Google). In any case, you must act within your means.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">Explanation</p><p>Regarding the choice of Debian 10 as the operating system, let me elaborate a bit: No matter what you have heard online, no matter which guru has told you that XXX version of Linux is better or XXX version of Linux is more powerful, these sectarian disputes have <strong>nothing to do with you right now</strong>! Using Debian 10 is enough to optimize your VPS server for security, stability, and performance (such as using cloud-optimized kernel, timely support of BBR, etc.). After you become familiar with Linux, you can try other Linux distributions.</p></div><h2 id="_2-2-obtaining-a-desired-domain-name" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-2-obtaining-a-desired-domain-name"><span>2.2 Obtaining a Desired Domain Name</span></a></h2><p>You need to obtain a domain name and add an A record in the DNS settings, pointing to the IP address of your VPS.</p><ol><li>Please choose a reliable international domain name service provider.
