Countless websites, apps, services, and even offline infrastructure are built on the foundation of Linux, which involves huge economic benefits and commercial value. This also means that there is a huge motivation for black and gray industries to launch attacks. However, these services are so important that major security vulnerabilities are not allowed. Therefore, countless operation and maintenance professionals are working hard on the battlefield of security attacks and defense, which enables us to enjoy a basic stable modern digital life.</p><p>Now, you have a VPS and will open its data access channel to achieve the goal of traffic forwarding, which means you are now on the front line of the security battle and face all risks. However, at the same time, newcomers tend to have a polarized view of security issues due to lack of knowledge and information: either they feel it is as light as a feather and has nothing to do with them, or they feel it is as heavy as Mount Tai and feel anxious all day long.</p><ul><li><p>For the former, my suggestion is: safety is of utmost importance. Try to gather more information on safety issues to avoid regretting after experiencing losses.</p></li><li><p>For the latter, my suggestion is: don&#39;t worry too much, our servers still don&#39;t have too much value and generally won&#39;t attract high-level attacks. The basic threats we need to face are mostly malicious scans and login attempts from some automated scripts. Just follow this article to do some basic protection.</p></li></ul><h2 id="_4-2-what-are-the-specific-risks" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-2-what-are-the-specific-risks"><span>4.2 What are the specific risks</span></a></h2><p>Just like the configuration we did in the &quot;Remote Login&quot; section, anyone who knows the four elements of [IP address] + [port] + [username] + [password] can log in to your VPS server. So obviously, the security of these four elements is the bottom line that we need to protect. Let&#39;s analyze them one by one:</p><ol><li><p>[IP Address]: Malicious scripts randomly attempt to scan IP ranges, which can be regarded as public information and cannot be hidden.</p></li><li><p>[Port]: If you are using the default port, then [Port = <code>22</code>].</p></li><li><p>[Username]: If using the default user, then [Username = <code>root</code>]</p></li><li><p>[Password]: There is no default value for the password. It must be randomly generated by the VPS backend or set by you. In other words, if all the settings of your server are default, then three of the four elements are already known. Therefore, the security of your entire server relies on a small password. In this case, there are several situations:</p></li></ol><ul><li><p>If you use a VPS management background to generate passwords randomly, it usually contains random uppercase and lowercase letters, symbols, and is relatively secure.</p></li><li><p>If you changed your password to something super weak like <code>123456</code> just for the sake of easy memorization, hacking into your VPS server would be a piece of cake.</p></li><li><p>If you change your password to a more complex one that you have used elsewhere just for the sake of easy memory, it is not really safe. You should understand that hackers have cheats in their hands, such as <code>password tables</code>, which contain tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, or even more real leaked passwords.</p></li></ul><ol start="5"><li>But you should understand that no hacker really sits in front of a computer and tries your password repeatedly. All attack attempts are carried out automatically by malicious scripts, which work tirelessly for 24 hours. Perhaps while you are sleeping soundly every night, your server is enduring round after round of attacks.</li></ol><p>Once the password is successfully cracked, it means that all four of your elements have been mastered by the attacker. The malicious script will quickly log in to the server, obtain the highest <code>root</code> control of the server, install and deploy its malicious services, and then use your server to do all kinds of bad things 24 hours a day (such as mining, spreading viruses, sending spam emails, fraudulent emails, acting as a BT relay, and even dark web public nodes, and so on). If the malicious script is relatively restrained, it can actually achieve considerable concealment. Generally, newcomers will not observe and pay attention to indicators such as login records, process changes, CPU usage changes, and traffic changes of the VPS, so it is difficult for you to discover that you have been hacked. Until your VPS service provider blocks your account or you receive a lawyer&#39;s letter.</p><ol start="6"><li>Don&#39;t forget that when you obtain a VPS, you probably need to use your real payment information, and when you log in to various websites and social platforms, your IP address will also be recorded, which has a direct or indirect relationship with your identity. Therefore, once these bad things happen, they will inevitably be associated with you.</li></ol><h2 id="_4-3-what-security-measures-do-we-need-to-take" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-3-what-security-measures-do-we-need-to-take"><span>4.3 What security measures do we need to take</span></a></h2><p>Based on the above analysis, what we need to do is to strengthen the three elements of [port], [username], and [password] to reduce the risk of being hacked.</p><ol><li>[Port]: Modify the SSH remote login port to a [non-22 port] (4.4).</li><li>[Username]: Create a [non-root] new user and disable root user SSH remote login (4.5, 4.6).</li><li>[Password]: Enable RSA key verification for SSH login and disable password verification login (4.7).</li></ol><p>Remember to follow the order and don&#39;t lock yourself out.</p><h2 id="_4-4-change-the-ssh-remote-login-port-to-a-non-22-port" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-4-change-the-ssh-remote-login-port-to-a-non-22-port"><span>4.4 Change the SSH Remote Login Port to a Non-22 Port</span></a></h2><p>Now, let&#39;s solve the problem of &quot;port = <code>22</code>&quot;.
